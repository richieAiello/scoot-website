Get Scootin



Scooter sharing made simple

Scoot takes the hassle out of urban mobility. Our bikes are placed in convenient 
locations in each of our cities. Use our app to locate the nearest bike, unlock 
it with a tap, and you’re away!

Get Scootin



Locate with app

Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are continuously placing scooters 
in the areas with most demand, so one should never be too far away. 

Pick your scooter

We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you. So you know how much 
charge they have left and can see roughly how much it will cost.

Enjoy the ride

Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock, put on a helmet, 
and you’re off! Always lock bikes away from walkways and accessibility ramps.



Easy to use riding telemetry

The Scoot app is available with riding telemetry. This means it can show you your 
average speed, how long you've been using the scooter, your traveling distance, 
and many more things all in an easy to use app.

scooters loose on 23 cities over the coming year.
